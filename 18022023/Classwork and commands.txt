Kubernetes networking allows components to 
communicate with each other and with other applications

Different types of networking in Kubernetes:--

Pod to Pod Networking
Pod to Service 
Container to Container 
Internet to service networking

Container to Container communications : this is solved by Pods and Localhost 
Internet to service communications - is taken care by Services

The network model is implemented by the container runtime on each node.
We can create network model for our pods or containers on each node using 
Networking tools such as cilium , vmware,flannel,cisco



What is cloud computing?
It is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the 
Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
Instead of buying,owning, and maintining physical data centers and servers
,we can acess technology services, such as computing power,storage,
and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider
like AWS, Azure, GCP
