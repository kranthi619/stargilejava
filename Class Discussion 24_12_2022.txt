Application developed using Java or .Net or Python
1. We want to deploy it using container
   First build an image of our application using Docker
   Push this image in the imgae repository(i.e. dockerhub.com)
   We have decided to deploy above application on AWS cloud infrastructure
   We will use AWS ECR and AWS ECS or AWS EKS   		
	
--- On demand provising of services or infrastruture
--- Secure environment
--- Cost as per usage 
--- Monitioring and Alerting
--- Time to deployment is less
--- When load on your application is more we will provision additional infrastructure or services as needed 



2. We want to run it without containers
   I will buy a server (hardware machine - from IBM,HP,Dell etc)
   I will install OS(Windows or Linux )
   Install Git
   Install Softwares (maven, java,python etc)
   Using git we will download the code this machine
   Compile and package it using maven tool
   Jar or War or EAR is created
   
   We will execute the jar file using the java command
   I will buy a separate server  for Database (hardware machine - from IBM,HP,Dell etc)
   I will install OS(Windows or Linux )
   I will install DB server( for eg Oracle or Mysql or MongoDB)
   Everything is done 
   Start the application 

	Disadvantages of Step 2
	-- High Cost
	-- Time to market is high
	-- Time to go on production is higher
	-- Not scalable
