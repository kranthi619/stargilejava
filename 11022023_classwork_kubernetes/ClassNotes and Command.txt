Docker Compose is a tool that was developed to help define and share multi-container applications. 
With Compose, we can create a YAML file to define the services and with a single command, 
can spin everything up or tear it all down.


docker-compose installation
Check the version 
sudo docker compose version
mkdir composetest
cd composetest
#create app.py using vi app.py
#create Dockerfile using vi Dockerfile
#create requirements.txt vi command
#create docker-compose.yml using vi command
#Refer below link for the above files content
#https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/
#Start the service using below command
sudo docker compose up
#Stop the service using below command
sudo docker compose down

Kubelet --- node agent running on node
kube-proxy --- network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster
kube api server ---The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.
etcd ----Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
         If your Kubernetes cluster uses etcd as its backing store, make sure you have a back up plan for those data.

kube-scheduler ---Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, 
                   and selects a node for them to run on.

kube-controller-manager ---  Control plane component that runs controller processes.


https://kuberty.io/blog/minikube-vs-kubectl/
minikube: a ONE Node cluster, where the master and worker processes are on the same machine. 
Kubectl, the command line tool for Kubernetes, then enables the interaction with the cluster: to create pods, services and other components.
By default, kubectl gets configured to access the kubernetes cluster control plane inside minikube when the minikube start command is executed.


NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more.
